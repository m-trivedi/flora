# Flora
A Python PyQT5 application that makes counselling services more accessible in over 10 schools

### The Homepage
The screenshot below shows the home page of the application. The application contains several pages that act like components. These components can either be brought up or pushed down in the z axis (through the screen). This enables the feature of switching between pages. Buttons trigger functions that perform these actions.

### The Login Page
The screenshot below shows the login page of the application. The application communicates with a MySQL backend and checks if the entered user credentials are correct. If they are, the authentication of the user is set to true and other user information such as assigned counsellors, assigned school, classmates are brought up.

# Flora
A Python PyQT5 application that makes counselling services more accessible in over 10 schools

### The Homepage
The screenshot below shows the home page of the application. The application contains several pages that act like components. These components can either be brought up or pushed down in the z axis (through the screen). This enables the feature of switching between pages. Buttons trigger functions that perform these actions.
